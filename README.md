# ESG Among Indonesian Firms
> Research project to understand the impact of ESG on firm performance and the popularity of ESG in Indonesia

## Information
- Data sources are Newswhip for news articles published related to particular keywords; Yahoo Finance to attempt to understand the correlation between financial peformance and ESG; and BCA financial reports
- The scope of the project was too small to do an in depth analysis of the impact of ESG on performance so the focus shifted towards getting an idea of the state of ESG in Indonesia
- Indonesian firms also largely lack data on ESG, especially on Yahoo Finance
- Through categorising the headlines, the waffle charts paint a picture of what sorts of projects firms engage in regarding ESG and CSR

## Further study
- Predicting ESG ratings based on firm financial performance
